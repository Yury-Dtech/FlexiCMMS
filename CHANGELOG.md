## 2025-07-29
### Added
- **Scheduler Context Menu**: Implemented a right-click context menu in the Scheduler. Users can now:
    - Create new appointments by right-clicking on an empty time slot.
    - Open, remove, or duplicate existing appointments by right-clicking on them.	
### Changed
- **Settings**: Changing the API address on the Settings page now automatically reloads the application to ensure the new settings are applied correctly.

    - The total order count is now displayed in the `OrdersPage` header.
- **Refactoring**:
    - Centralized color management into `AppStateService` to ensure a consistent color scheme across all components (`SchedulerSummary`, `OrdersPage`, `SchedulerPage`).
    - Components now subscribe to `AppStateService.OnChange` to dynamically update their appearance when the color scheme is changed.
- **API Address Change**: Implemented a mechanism to restart the application after changing the external API address on the Settings page. This ensures that the new address is correctly applied.

### Fixed
- **Scheduler Drag & Drop**: Fixed a critical bug where dragging a work order from the grid to the Scheduler would fail if the Scheduler was not in "Timeline" view. The assignment logic now correctly applies only to the Timeline view, preventing errors in other views.

## 2025-07-23
### Added
- **Build Date Display**: Implemented a mechanism to display the application's build date in the main layout, providing clear versioning information.

- **Orders Page Filtering**: Introduced a new filter for "Assigned persons" on the Orders page, allowing users to narrow down the work order list by specific team members.

### Fixed
- **Scheduler Drag & Drop**: Corrected an issue where dragging a work order from the grid to the Scheduler's timeline did not correctly assign the appointment to the target person (resource).
- **Filter UI Behavior**: The "Assigned persons" filter on the Orders page now updates the list instantly when cleared via the "Clear" button.
- **Filter Label Alignment**: Fixed the alignment of the "Assigned persons" filter label on the Orders page to ensure it is positioned correctly above the multiselect component, consistent with other filters.

## 2025-07-22

- **Scheduler Loading Indicator:** Added a loading indicator to the scheduler to provide visual feedback during data fetching and authorization processes.

## Changed
- **Scheduler Grouping Logic:** Resolved `KeyNotFoundException` in Timeline view grouping by ensuring the correct resource field (`AssignedPerson`) is referenced in `SchedulerGroupSettings`.

- **Cache Management Refactoring:** Refactored internal cache management for appointments, leading to more efficient data handling and smoother UI updates in the scheduler.
- **Appointment Service Method Rename:** Renamed `CloseAppointment` method to `RemoveAppointment` in the `AppointmentService` for clearer semantics.

## Fixed
- `KeyNotFoundException`: Addressed the `KeyNotFoundException` occurring when switching to the Telerik Scheduler Timeline view, specifically when grouping by assigned persons.


## 2025-07-21
- **Refactoring & Bug Fixes:**
    - Refactored cache management in `ApiServiceClient` for `WorkOrder` objects to ensure data consistency. Implemented centralized methods for updating, invalidating, and refreshing the cache (`UpdateWorkOrderInCache`, `InvalidateWorkOrdersCache`, `RefreshWorkOrderInCacheAsync`).
    - All `WorkOrder` manipulation methods (`Update`, `Save`, `Close`) now use the new centralized cache logic.
    - Corrected the UI update logic in `SchedulerPage.razor`. The local appointment collection (`_allAppointments`) is now correctly modified when an appointment is changed or closed, ensuring the UI reflects the current state.
    - Enhanced `AppointmentEditor.razor` to support closing work orders and properly propagate UI updates.
    - Added the `WorkOrderInfo.cs` model and updated `WoController` to support fetching detailed work order information.

## 2025-07-09
- **Functionality & UI:**
    - Implemented the complete lifecycle for Work Orders, allowing users to create, update, and close them through the API.
    - Added robust validation for required fields (like Description, Level) in the Work Order editor, with visual highlighting for missing data.
    - Closing a Work Order now requires at least one associated activity.
    - Pop-up notifications now display specific error messages from the API, providing clearer user feedback.
- **Technical & Refactoring:**
    - Implemented a server-side session check on application load. Users are now automatically logged out if their server session is invalid, preventing API errors.
    - Refactored `ApiServiceClient` methods (`Save`, `Update`, `Close`) to return a `SingleResponse<T>` object, providing detailed error information.
    - Added dedicated API endpoints and request models (`WorkOrderCreateRequest`, `UpdateWorkOrderRequest`, `CloseWorkOrderRequest`) for all Work Order operations.
    - Switched from using string names to IDs for entities like Categories and Levels, improving data integrity.

## 2025-07-08
- **Work Order Management Enhancement**: Implemented client-side validation and mapping of `WorkOrder` to `WorkOrderCreateRequest` in `ApiServiceClient.SaveWorkOrderAsync`. The `WoController.Create` endpoint now directly accepts `WorkOrderCreateRequest`. `ApiServiceClient.UpdateWorkOrderAsync` now utilizes `SaveWorkOrderAsync` for new work orders, ensuring consistent API saving. Added `ReasonID`, `CategoryID`, `DepartmentID`, and `AssignedPersonID` fields to `WorkOrderCreateRequest`.
- **Client-Server Token Synchronization**: Implemented a robust mechanism where the Blazor server retrieves external API tokens from its cache using the `PersonID` provided by the client in a custom `X-Person-ID` HTTP header. This eliminates the need for the client to directly send the external API token to the Blazor server.
- **Client-side Initialization Enhancement**: Ensured that `UserState` data is fully loaded from `localStorage` before any client-side API calls are made. This was achieved by awaiting `UserState.InitializationTask` in `AuthHeaderHandler` and relevant Razor pages (`SchedulerPage`, `OrdersPage`, `Settings`).
- **Server-side Token Management**: The `IdentityController` now caches `IdentityData` (including the external API token) upon successful user login. The `ServerAuthTokenService` has been refactored to retrieve these tokens from the server's `IMemoryCache` based on the `PersonID` extracted from the `X-Person-ID` header.
- **API Error Handling**: Added `try-catch` blocks to all HTTP request methods within `ApiServiceClient` to gracefully handle network and API errors, logging them to the console and returning empty/default values.
- **Dependency Refinement and Cleanup**: Removed obsolete JWT Bearer authentication configurations and hardcoded login credentials from the server-side `Program.cs`, streamlining the authentication and dependency injection setup.
- **API Documentation**: Added `API-info.md` to provide clear documentation of API endpoints and their authorization types.
